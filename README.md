# ROLF. - A guiding app for young boys who have had to grow up without a father figure.

#### The app aims to teach simple things that a father usually teaches his son, such as how to shave, how to tie a tie, etc. The purpose of this app is firstly to answer questions that a fatherless boy might want to ask his father and secondly, possibly provide assistance with some practical matters.

#

# Executing the program

- The use of the application is very simple. Just execute the code via your command line or PyCharm and follow along the steps in the app. If you have any questions, feel free to send me a message.
